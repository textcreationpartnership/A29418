            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A BRIEF and MODEST REPRESENTATION OF THE Preſent State &amp; Condition OF IRELAND. <add>1. March: 1688/9.</add>
            </head>
            <argument>
               <p>Licenſed, <hi>Febr.</hi> 27. 1688/9.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is manifeſt, and well known to all the World, that <hi>Ireland</hi> (which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to, and part of the Dominions of <hi>England</hi>) hath for many years been kept in Obedience to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by a conſtant and great Expence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood and Treaſure, the frequent Rebellions of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and their many Attempts wholly to extirpate the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> neceſſarily requiring a continual ſupply of Men and Money from <hi>England,</hi> to ſupport the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt in that Iſland, which could not be effected without a ſtanding <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army there.</p>
            <p>And it is as plain, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> taking the Advantage of the Reducing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army there to too ſmall a number, and of the Civil Diſcords at that time in <hi>England,</hi> did on the 23 of <hi>October</hi> 1641, (without cauſe or provocation) enter into the moſt barbarous and bloody Rebellion that ever was known, in hopes to reſcue themſelves from ſubjection to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although when that Rebellion was ſuppreſt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government did not inflict National Puniſhments for thoſe National Crimes, as in juſtice it might have done, but on the contrary, reſtored near five Millions of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acres of Land, to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, which to this day are in their actual poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>England</hi> did not ſo far forget its proper Intereſt of keeping <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in ſubjection, and of protecting and encourageing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in that Kingdom, but that (amidſt all the Mercies and Favours it diſpenc'd to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts) a conſiderable Proteſtant Army was ſtill kept on foot, and all Power Civil and Military was put into the Hands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants; and herein <hi>England</hi> was ſo careful, as to incert a Clauſe, in all the Chief Governors Commiſſions, (even in the Earl of <hi>Tyrconell</hi>'s) not to diſpoſe the conſiderable Offices of Truſt, except to ſuch as were <hi>de Stirpe Anglicana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe Means <hi>Ireland</hi> grew capable to make ſome returns to <hi>England</hi> for its great Concern and Charge, and the Publick Revenue which <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, did not much exceed 6000 l. improv'd to that Degree, that it was farm'd at 240000 <hi>l.</hi> in the year 1679. and ſince that time yielded 300000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in ſome years after, inſomuch, that beſides ſeveral Conſiderable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Penſions that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54725:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>were paid out of that Revenue, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the late King <hi>James</hi> had 30000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> paid to the Privy-Purſe for ſeveral years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>But of late, all thoſe ſolid and Fundamental Maxims have been ſubverted, the Conquering <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been put under the power of the Conquered <hi>Iriſh,</hi> both the Civil and Military Government of that Kingdom have been put into the Hands of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, even of ſuch forfeiting Papiſts as cannot be reſtored, but by the expulſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and whoſe Intereſt as well as Inclination, drives them to endeavour the Ruine and Extirpation of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was Disbanded, and the Militia Diſarmed, and all the Power of that Kingdom was under the Adminiſtration of ſuch as were Irreconcilable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>England,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion, (which, it was much to be feared, was the Model deſign'd for another place) by thoſe means the flouriſhing Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt was expoſed to the Mercy of ſuch Enemies as had given but too many Inſtances of their Implacable Cruelty. But as if all this was not enough to deſtroy the Proteſtants, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have of late been let looſe, vaſt quantities of Arms and Ammunition have been given them out of the Stores, they are every where Arrayed and Liſted, ſo that there are at leaſt 50000 of them at this time in Arms, and under Diſcipline, in Troops, Companies, and Regiments.</p>
            <p>This Numerous Army could not be ſupported without Rapine, Free-quarter, and all the Exhorbitancies incident to ſuch a Licencious Multitude.</p>
            <p>The Conſequences whereof are, that Trade in that Kingdom is extinguiſh'd, and that Multitudes of the Miſerable <hi>Engliſh</hi> have already been forced to fly to <hi>England,</hi> others to flock together in Cities, Towns, and Caſtles, leaving their Cattle and Perſonal Eſtate expoſed to the Mercy of that Ravenous Army, which have already ſeized all the Caſtle in the County of <hi>Longford,</hi> and above 12000 Head of Black Cattle in the County of <hi>Corke,</hi> beſides infinite Numbers in other parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In this deplorable Condition are the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in moſt parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this day, every Minute expecting to be Maſſacred, by their Numerous and Inveterate Enemies, who are Gariſon'd in the very Towns and Cities the Proteſtants are fled to for Sanctuary, nor is their danger leſs of being ſtarv'd, though they ſhould eſcape the Sword, and they are without Queſtion begger'd and undone, though they ſhould, by the miraculous Providence of God, eſcape the dangers both of Sword and Famine.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, this Miſerable People, even as they are few in Number, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their Adverſaries, and deſtitute of Arms and Ammunition, and other Means of Defence, have not totally diſponded, but rather (like true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and Proteſtants) have raiſed their Courage as their Diſtreſſes increaſe, and will not believe but their Brethren in <hi>England</hi> will ſend them ſeaſonable Relief.</p>
            <p>And they well hope, that even moderate Aſſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> if ſent before it be too late, would put them in a Capacity to Live and Defend themſelves, and the Places they are poſſeſſed of, until greater Supplies can be ſent, which may enable them to reduce that Nation to a perfect and entire Obedience to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> how inſolent ſoever they are at this Conjuncture, are nevertheleſs the ſame People they have ſo often Conquer'd.</p>
            <p>And though the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> (where the <hi>britiſh</hi> are more Numerous and Strong) is in a far better Condition than the reſt of that Kingdom, nevertheleſs, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> not Conſidering that, nor the Ruine, Deſolation and Famine, that will be the Natural Conſequence of their Raſhneſs, do daily threaten the Deſtruction of the Proteſtants, and many of them have proceeded to that degree of Folly and Inſolence, as to Menace, even Invaſion of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I could heartily wiſh, that that unfortunate Iſland were buried in the Sea, but ſince God and Nature have placed it above Water, in a ſituation that may render it ſo diſadvantageous to <hi>England,</hi> (lying as it doth in the Line of Trade) I muſt uſe my utmoſt Endeavours (as every good <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ought to do) that <hi>Ireland</hi> may not be a Thorn in our Side, nor prove ſo fatal to the Trade and ſafety of <hi>England,</hi> as it would certainly be, if the Harbours of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were in an Enemies Hands.</p>
